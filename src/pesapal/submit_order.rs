//! The submit order endpoint allows to create new payment order
//! A good example would be a case where the customer has clicked pay now
//! button on your website. At this point, you call the SubmitOrderRequest and
//! in return you will get a response which contains a payment redirect URL
//! which you then redirect the customer to or load the URL as an iframe within
//! your site in case you donâ€™t want to redirect the customer off your application.

//! The payment URL will contain the payment methods presented to the customer
//! by Pesapal. After the customer has made the payment, they will be
//! redirected to your callback URL which you will have already provided to us
//! as part of submit order request.
